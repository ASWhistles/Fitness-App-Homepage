# Fitness-App-Homepage
This week's assignment was to create a homepage of a fitness app.
Since my homies and I are participating in 75-soft challenge, I figured I would make a prototype of a tracker.
Here is the result on Figma Design!

I added an animation from Figma - made a component set and added a smart animation with a bounce...shown in the video below

I'm excited to try out more with animations on Figma...to be continued!
